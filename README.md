Machine Learning Models to Predict Flight Data Delays and Cancelations

Airlines place a huge focus on customer satisfaction and with new airlines entering the market, the situation becomes more challenging. 
Capturing important insights would not only help them go farther but will also assist them in developing a solid consumer base. 
This report has performed several classifications predictive models, including trees and deep learning neural networks. 
The flight data was pre-processed, normalized, and scaled to produce reliable predictions. 
Predictions for arrival delays with and without departure delays were conducted to test the models' efficiency, and models did detect higher accuracy with departure delays, resulting in a cascade effect. To make an informed judgement, predictions for cancellations were obtained. 
When the various models were compared, it was discovered that the Bagging Model with tuning performed better than the other models in terms of arrival delay predictions without considering departure delays, while the Logistic Regression performed better in terms of cancellation predictions. 
Feature importance for each scenario were studied and useful recommendations were obtained for airlines company.
